# Cheer Routine Machine

## V1
Version 1 was written in vanilla javascript using teachable machine.
Download the html and css files from the top level to see it working.

## V2
Version 2 was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I started using ml5 but switched it out in favour of pure tensorflow.

In the project directory cheer-react, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
